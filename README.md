# IPL-Win-Predictor
This project predicts the **winning probability of an IPL team** based on real-time match data using machine learning algorithms.
This system takes live match inputs like runs, wickets, overs, and teams — and predicts the chances (%) of both teams winning the match using trained ML models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook
